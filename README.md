# SyncPro

SyncPro is a Windows desktop application for synchronizing files across different online services and the local computer, eliminating the need to have multiple agents running on your computer to keep files synchronized. Additionally, by having a single common platform to manage file synchronization, features can be shared regardless of the service, and using a single UI.

SyncPro currently supports the following online storage services:

|   Online Service  |  Status  |

The main window of SyncPro provides an at-a-glance view of the sync relationships. Last sync time, last sync result, and other useful information is displayed for each relationship.
